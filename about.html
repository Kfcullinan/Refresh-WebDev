        An automotive service manager excited to embark on his new career in full stack software engineering and make it his new professional 127.0.0.1. I am a dedicated and driven team member who always strives to push myself, encourage my team, seek opportunities for professional development, and consistently produce a quality product.

When I am not solving missing semicolons or fathering my almost 2 year old son, I enjoy working on and riding my Triumph Bonneville motorcycle, dreaming of buying a 1968-1975 A-Body Mopar, and walking my three-legged dog, Lieutenant Dan.
